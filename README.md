# Hospital-Length-of-Stay-Cost-Forecasting


Hospitals often struggle to accurately predict the costs associated with patient length of stay due to a variety of factors including demographic, medical, and financial variables. This project aims to identify the key drivers of this relationship and develop a predictive model that forecasts hospitalization costs based on both length of stay and patient-specific features. The following people were the contributors to this project: Rebecca Bubis (myself), Sanjal Desai, Crystal Leatvanich, and Courtney Vincent.
